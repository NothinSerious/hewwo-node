HEWWO????? OwO

Based on [embr](https://github.com/liclac)'s [script](https://gist.github.com/liclac/44d5ecb1d01594c8860b157040090a3a) (itself based on leafysweetsgarden's OWO extension),
idea by [ln(x)áµ‰](https://twitter.com/tachiniererin/status/1262790041954377730)

A deployed instance can be found at https://hewwo.lovelyrad.io

## Installation

```shell
npm install
node index.js
```
Defaut port is 3000 and it's hardcoded in the code because I am a terrible person

## Usage

```shell
$ curl -X POST -d "hello world" -o- [url_of_the_instance]
hewwo wowwd
```
Or basically just send a POST request to the server
